# anki_autobury_added_today 

## what is this?
A script that buries anki cards that have been added today but have not been buried.

## Anything worth mentioning?
* ~~I use a cron job to call this script every hour.~~
* I run this script manually because it freezes anki for up to a second, messing up with what I'm currently doing on anki
* This scripts needs the [ankiconnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) addon, possibly only my fork as the author has not yet approved of my commits that allow to bury cards.
