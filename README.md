# anki_autobury_added_today 

## what is this?
A script that buries anki cards that have been added today but have not been buried.

## Anything worth mentioning?
* I run this script manually because it freezes anki for a short instant, messing up with what I'm currently typing on anki.
* To use this scripts, you need to install a fork of the [ankiconnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) addon called [AnnA Companion](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/447942356). I developed this addon for an entirely separate reason but it still does the job.
